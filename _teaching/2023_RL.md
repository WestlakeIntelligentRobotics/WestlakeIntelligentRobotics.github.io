I have been teaching **a course on reinforcement learning** at Westlake University for three years. **This course aims to** provide a mathematical but friendly introduction to the fundamental concepts, basic problems, and classical algorithms in reinforcement learning, which is a core discipline in the areas of artificial intelligence. **The topics covered in the course include** the Bellman equation, Bellman optimality equation, value iteration/policy iteration algorithms, Monte-Carlo based algorithms, temporal-difference algorithms, function approximation, and policy gradient algorithms. Along with the teaching, **I have been writting a book** as the lecture notes for my students.

- The PDF of the book and the lecture slides can be found on the [GitHub homepage](https://github.com/MathFoundationRL/Book-Mathmatical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning)
- The lecture videos can be found at the [Bilibili homepage](https://space.bilibili.com/2044042934) and [Youtube homepage](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCztGtS5YYiNv8x3pj9hLVgg/playlists)
- The introduction to the book can be found at the [Zhihu page](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/552853273) 
- (update in Nov 2022) My book will be **published jointly by Springer Nature and Tsinghua University Press**. It will be printed arond the second half of 2023.

We will keep updating the videos and slides. Please stay tuned.
