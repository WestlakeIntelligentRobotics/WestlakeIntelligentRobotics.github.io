Welcome to our project page on GitHub. This page shows our recent research work.

Our lab, the Intelligent Unmanned Systems Laboratory at Westlake University, focuses on novel theories and applications of robotic systems, especially multi-robot systems. We are interested in next-generation robotic systems that are interesting, meaningful, and challenging to study.
