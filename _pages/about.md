Our lab focuses on novel theories and applications of robotic systems, especially multi-robot systems. We are interested in next-generation robotic systems that are interesting, meaningful, and challenging to study. Currently, we have more than 20 group members including postdocs, Ph.D. students, research engineers, and research assistants. Each of them focuses on a specific interesting research direction and in the meantime collaborates with others to create more impactful research results. We have first-rate studying and experimental facilities. More importantly, we have a good scientific research atmosphere that enables students to concentrate to create high-quality research results.

**Position openings:** We are now particularly seeking excellent applicants in the fields of *reinforcement learning and automatic control*. If you are interested, please drop me an email. If you are excellent in other fields, you are also welcome to send me an application. Before sending me an email, please check our website carefully to get to know our lab better. I would only respond to those that I think might be suitable.
